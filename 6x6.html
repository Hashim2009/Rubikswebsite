    <p>The V-Cube 6 is a 6×6×6 version of the original Rubik's Cube. The first mass-produced 6×6×6 was invented by Panagiotis Verdes and is produced by the Greek company Verdes Innovations SA. Other such puzzles have since been introduced by a number of
        Chinese companies, some of which have mechanisms which improve on the original. Unlike the original puzzle (but like the 4×4×4 cube) , it has no fixed facets: the center facets (16 per face) are free to move to different positions. Methods for
        solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 6×6×6 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colors — since the center facets can no longer be used for identification.</p>
