    <p>The Skewb is a combination puzzle and a mechanical puzzle in the style of the Rubik's Cube. It was invented by Tony Durham and marketed by Uwe MÃ¨ffert. Although it is cubical in shape, it differs from Rubik's construction in that its axes of rotation
        pass through the corners of the cube rather than the centres of the faces. There are four such axes, one for each space diagonal of the cube. As a result, it is a deep-cut puzzle in which each twist affects all six faces.</p>
